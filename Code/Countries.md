# Countries

#### MISSPELLING

* 'Azerbaidjan' (mispelled in 2017) = 'Azerbaijan' (2015, 2016, 2018)
* 'Tadjikistan' (2017) MISPELLED = 'Tajikistan' (2015, 16, 18)....Correct spelling is 'Tajikistan'
* 'Viet Nam' (2018) = 'Vietnam' (2014-17) MISPELLING AGAIN!

#### REWORDING

* 'Antigua & Deps' (2015 & 2016) = 'Antigua and Barbuda' (2017 & 2018). We should change 2015 & 2016 as 'Antigua and Barbuda'

* 'Bosnia and Herzegovina' (2014, 2018) = 'Bosnia Herzegovina' (2015, 2016) = "Bosnia-Herzegovina" (2017)

* 'Brunei' (2015) = 'Brunei Darussalam' (2017, 2018) is the full name of the country

* 'Burkina' (2015,2016) = 'Burkina Faso' (2017,2018)
* 'Ivory Coast' (2016) = 'Ivory Coast (Cote D'Ivoire)' (2017) = 'CÃ´te d'Ivoire' (2018)

* 'Democratic People's Republic of Korea' (2018) = 'Korea North' (2015, 16) = 'North Korea' (2017, 18)
* 'Moldova' (2014, 15, 16) = 'Republic of Moldova' (2018)
* 'Macedonia' (2015-17) = 'Macedonia [FYROM]' (2014) = 'The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia' (2018)

#### LESS THAN 3 OBSERVATIONS

* 'East Timor' (2016) = 'Timor-Leste' (2018)
* 'Central African Rep' (2016) = 'Central African Republic' (2018) <-- only two observations, so we will eliminate this anyone

* 'Congo {Democratic Rep}' = "Congo, Republic of the..." only two observations so eliminate. 'Democratic Republic of the Congo' was also listed but only in 2018 which is also when "Congo, Republic of the..." was...a duplicate in the listing of the 2018 survey maybe? Still, can't include it.
* 'Libya' (2017) = 'Libyan Arab Jamahiriya' (2018) - two observations, eliminate
* 'Micronesia' (2016) = 'Micronesia, Federated States of...' (2018) = 'Nauru' (2018) - two observations, get rid of them.

#### NOT THE SAME

* To my surprise, 'Dominica' and 'Dominican Republic' are two completely different countries AND same with 'Guinea' and 'Guinea-Bissau'

#### SUMMARY

* 30 duplicates (not including the "less than 3 observations" duplicates)
* 10 uniquely phrased countries to eliminate
* unknown number of countries that don't have enough observations (haven't looked yet; need to clean data and figure it out again)
* 259 unique names - 30 - 10 = 219 potential countries
