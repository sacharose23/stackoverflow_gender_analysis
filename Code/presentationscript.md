Good afternoon, everyone. I am the project coordinator of my team. Sebastian is our statistician and Yuxin is our Analyst. 

Today I will present our project background and data details. 

Raise your hand if you have used Stack Overflow before.

Stack Overflow has been an online resource for people like us for about 10 years. It is the world's largest developer community.

And just about 8 years ago they started conducting an annual survey for developers.

Just so we're all on the same page, let's take a short tour of their homepage.

Here are some tid-bits about the study.

[Definition of developer and professional developer]

The types of data that were collected (not necessarily in this order) include info on the dev's roles in the field, experience in the field, past and current education, demographics such as gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. 

Technology questions were also asked, which included info on their working environments and the tech tools they use such as IDEs and version control. 

Other questions specific to work were asked. Salary, work culture...their opinions regarding some scenarios that challenged ethics.

Lastly, questions about their community involvement were asked. Specifically their involvement on Stack Overflow. To what level have they used S.O. and to what level have they contributed.

So, that's the content that was covered in the survey. Now, let's see what some of the the raw data looks like.

Here, I've included my husband's answers to 6 out of the 129 questions from 2018 survey. This is him hard at work with his two friends : the patient rubber ducky in the bottom right corner and the magical unicorn whispering code in his ear I'm sure.

Now, let's talk about some scientific questions that we can investigate using this open-source survey data.
